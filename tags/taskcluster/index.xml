      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most painful aspects of a developer&amp;rsquo;s work cycle is trying to fix failures that show up
on try, but which can&amp;rsquo;t be reproduced locally. When this happens, there were really only two
options (neither of them nice):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You could spam try with print debugging. But this isn&amp;rsquo;t very powerful, and takes forever to get
feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You could request a loaner from releng. But this is a heavy handed process, and once you have the
loaner it is very hard to get tests up and running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to announce there is now a third option, which is easy, powerful and 100% self-serve.
Rather than trying to explain it in words, here is a ~5 minute demo:&lt;/p&gt;
