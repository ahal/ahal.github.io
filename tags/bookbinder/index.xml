      <description>&lt;p&gt;I mentioned in my previous post a mercurial extension I wrote for making bookmarks easier to
manipulate. Since then it has undergone a large overhaul, and I believe it is now stable and
intuitive enough to advertise a bit more widely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working with bookmarks (or anonymous heads) I often wanted to operate on the
entire series of commits within the feature I was working on. I often found myself digging out
revision numbers to find the first commit in a bookmark to do things like rebasing, grafting or
diffing. This was annoying. I wanted bookmarks to work more like a git-style branch, that has a
definite start as well as an end. And I wanted to be able to easily refer to the set of commits
contained within. Enter &lt;a href=&#34;https://hg.sr.ht/~ahal/bookbinder&#34;&gt;bookbinder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
