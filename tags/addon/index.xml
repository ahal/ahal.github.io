      <title>How to bulk install Firefox Addons</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Firefox is known for its extensibility. In fact, over 2.4 &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt; addons have been downloaded to date,
meaning there are a lot of people using a lot of addons. While having 20+ addons can undoubtedly personalize your
browsing experience, it can also be a pain in the ass to manually install them every time you set up a new
Firefox profile. As a developer working on Firefox related automation tools, this is twice as
true since I create a separate profile for each and every project I work on, installing a constant set of
addons on each one.&lt;/p&gt;
