      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently redone my website and wanted to document a few of the changes and motivations behind
them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in high school and throughout most of my University career, I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought that personal blogs were dumb. Who in their right mind would care what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; was up to?
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I started interning at Mozilla that my views started to shift. I began seeing them as tools to communicate new ideas and elicit feedback from anyone
interested in what you have to say. It also wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I started interning at Mozilla that I realized that I actually &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have something interesting to say.
So here I am, creating a blog with one month left in my second internship. Too little too late? Maybe, but I have to start at some point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
