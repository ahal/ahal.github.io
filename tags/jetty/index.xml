      <title>Python 3 at Mozilla</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mozilla uses a lot of Python. Most of our build system, CI configuration, test harnesses, command
line tooling and countless other scripts, tools or Github projects are all handled by Python. In
mozilla-central there are over 3500 Python files (excluding third party files), comprising roughly
230k lines of code. Additionally there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mozilla?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;type=&amp;amp;language=python&#34;&gt;462 repositories&lt;/a&gt; labelled with Python in the Mozilla
org on Github (though many of these are not active). That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of Python, and most of it is
Python 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Python 2&amp;rsquo;s exaugural year well underway, it is a good time to take stock of the situation and
ask some questions. How far along has Mozilla come in the Python 3 migration? Which large work items
lie on the critical path? And do we have a plan to get to a good state in time for Python 2&amp;rsquo;s EOL on
January 1st, 2020?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
