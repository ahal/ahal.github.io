      <description>&lt;p&gt;So here in Toronto another cyclist was killed today. I&amp;rsquo;m a little bit frustrated with the state of
cycling in Toronto in general.  On one hand you have people like Mr. Ford who think that cyclists
are always to blame and should be run off the road, and on the other you have cyclists who actually
do run reds and wear black in the middle of the night giving the rest of us a bad name.  I decided I
need to write down my thoughts if for no other reason than to calm down.  In an ideal world,
cyclists would all respect the rules of the road and cars would always be alert for cyclists around
them.  However this will never happen so it is up to you, the cyclist, to ride cautiously.&lt;/p&gt;
