      <description>&lt;p&gt;While responsiveness is one of the main goals for Firefox this quarter, we still don&amp;rsquo;t quite have
the means to measure and test our progress towards this goal. The good news is that there are, and
have been for some time, several efforts to fix this problem. Back in June, Ted wrote some &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.mozilla.com/ted/2011/06/27/measuring-ui-responsiveness/&#34;&gt;event
tracing instrumentation&lt;/a&gt; that gives us a reasonable idea of when the browser becomes
unresponsive. This event tracer is already being used by some Talos tests which gives us a good
general idea of whether or not Firefox is more or less responsive than it was previously. What it
doesn&amp;rsquo;t give us is a method for developers to write their own tests and determine whether a specific
action or feature they are working on is causing unresponsivness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
