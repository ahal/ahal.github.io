  <p>I&rsquo;ve previously <a href="https://ahal.ca/blog/2015/try-syntax/">blogged</a> about why I believe try syntax is an antiquated development process
that should be replaced with something more modern and flexible. What follows is a series of ideas
that I&rsquo;m trying to convert into a concrete plan of action to bring this about. This is not an
<em>Intent to Implement</em> or anything like that, but my hope is that this outline is detailed enough
that it could be used as a solid starting point by someone with enough time and motivation to
work on it.</p>
<p>This plan of action will operate on the rather large assumption that all tasks are scheduled with
taskcluster (either natively or over BuildbotBridge). I also want to be clear that I&rsquo;m not talking
about removing try syntax completely. I simply think it should be parsed client side, <em>before</em> any
changes get pushed to try.</p>
<h2 id="brief-overview-of-how-try-syntax-currently-works-in-taskcluster">Brief Overview of How Try Syntax Currently Works in Taskcluster</h2>
<p>In order to understand where we&rsquo;re going, I think it&rsquo;s important to be aware of where we&rsquo;re coming
from. This is a high level explanation of how a try syntax string currently gets turned into running
tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>A developer pushes a commit to try with a &lsquo;try:&rsquo; token somewhere in the commit message.</li>
<li>The pushlog mercurial extension picks this up on the server, and publishes a <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/try/json-pushes?full=1">JSON stream</a>.</li>
<li>After getting triggered via a pulse message, the <a href="https://github.com/taskcluster/mozilla-taskcluster">mozilla-taskcluster</a> module <a href="https://github.com/taskcluster/mozilla-taskcluster/blob/4c45d5d0d1da012fcc541998ec7f611175464189/src/pushlog/client.js#L109">queries</a>
this URL and <a href="https://github.com/taskcluster/mozilla-taskcluster/blob/4c45d5d0d1da012fcc541998ec7f611175464189/src/jobs/taskcluster_graph.js#L82">pulls in</a> the relevant push.</li>
<li>Then, <a href="https://github.com/taskcluster/mozilla-taskcluster">mozilla-taskcluster</a> grabs the last commit in the push, extracts the try syntax from
the description, and uses it to create a <a href="https://github.com/taskcluster/mozilla-taskcluster/blob/4c45d5d0d1da012fcc541998ec7f611175464189/src/jobs/taskcluster_graph.js#L96">templating variable</a>.</li>
<li>This template variable is substituted into the <a href="http://gecko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/taskcluster/taskcluster/taskgraph.html#decision-task">decision task&rsquo;s</a> configuration, and ultimately
ends up getting <a href="https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/d11c29c1db3a1bc96ad5792ebf8a89b2fbadcf85/.taskcluster.yml#107">passed into</a> <code>mach taskgraph decision</code> with the <code>--message</code> parameter.</li>
<li>The decision task kicks off the <a href="http://gecko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/taskcluster/taskcluster/taskgraph.html#graph-generation">taskgraph generation</a> process. When it comes time to
<a href="http://gecko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/taskcluster/taskcluster/taskgraph.html#optimization">optimize</a>, the try syntax is finally passed into the <a href="https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/d11c29c1db3a1bc96ad5792ebf8a89b2fbadcf85/taskcluster/taskgraph/try_option_syntax.py#253">TryOptionSyntax</a> parser, which
filters out tasks that don&rsquo;t match any of the try options.</li>
<li>The optimized task graph is then submitted to taskcluster, and the relevant tasks start running
on try.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="an-improved-data-transport">An Improved Data Transport</h2>
<p>A key thing to realize, is that the decision task runs from within a mozilla-central clone. In other
words the try syntax string starts in version control, gets published to a webserver, gets
downloaded by a node module, gets substituted into a task configuration, only to be passed into a
process that had full access to the original version control all along. Steps 2-5 in the previous
section, could be replaced with:</p>
<ul>
<li>The decision task extracts the try syntax from the appropriate commit message.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we stopped there, this change wouldn&rsquo;t be worth making. It might make some code a bit cleaner,
but would hardly make things faster or more efficient since mozilla-taskcluster would still need to
query the pushlog either way. But this method has another, more important benefit: it gives the
decision task access to the entire commit instead of limiting it to whatever the pushlog extension
decides to publish.</p>
<p>That means there would be no particular reason we&rsquo;d need to store try syntax strings in the commit
message at all. We could instead stuff it into the commit as arbitrary metadata using the commit&rsquo;s
<code>extra</code> field. To get this working, we could use the <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/tip/hgext/push-to-try">push-to-try</a> extension to stuff the try
syntax into the <code>extra</code> field like <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/6a5b4c985ffc/hgext/overlay/__init__.py#l130">this</a>. Then the decision task could extract that syntax out
of the commit metadata like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ hg log -r $GECKO_HEAD_REV -T <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;{extras}&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="an-improved-data-format">An Improved Data Format</h2>
<p>Again, these changes mostly amount to a refactoring and wouldn&rsquo;t be worth making just for the sake
of it. But once we are using arbitrary commit metadata to pass information to the decision task,
there&rsquo;s no reason for us to limit ourselves to a single line syntax string. We could use data
structures of arbitrary complexity.</p>
<p>One possibility (which I&rsquo;ll run with for the rest of the post), is simply to use a list of
taskcluster task labels as the data format. This has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s unambiguous (what is passed in, is what will be scheduled)</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s an easy target for tools to generate to</li>
<li>It provides flexibility in how we could potentially interact with try (via said tools)</li>
</ul>
<p>The last two points are pretty big, have you ever attempted to write a tool that tries to convert
inputs into a try sytnax? It&rsquo;s very hard, and involves lots of hard coding in the tool and
memorization on the part of the users.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;ve done to this point is transform the data transport from a human friendly format to a
machine friendly format on top of which human friendly tools can be built. Probably the first tool
that will need to be built, will be a legacy try syntax specifier for those of us who enjoy writing
out try syntax strings. But that&rsquo;s not very interesting. There are probably a hundred different ways
we could dream of specifying tasks, but because my imagination is limited, I&rsquo;ll just talk about one
potential idea.</p>
<h2 id="fuzzy-finding-tasks">Fuzzy Finding Tasks</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently discovered and become a huge fan of <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fuzzyfinder</a>. Fuzzyfinder the project
consists of two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>A binary called <code>fzf</code></li>
<li>A vast multitude of shell and editor integrations that utilize <code>fzf</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The integrations allow you to quickly find things like file paths, processes and shell history (both
on the terminal or within an editor) with an intelligent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching">approximate matching</a> algorithm at
blazing speeds. While the integrations are insanely useful, it&rsquo;s the binary itself that would come
in useful here.</p>
<p>The <code>fzf</code> binary is actually quite simple. It receives a list of strings through <code>stdin</code>, allows the
user to select one or more of them using the fuzzy finding algorithm and a text based gui, then
prints all selected strings to <code>stdout</code>. The input is completely arbitrary, for example, I could
fuzzy select running processes with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ ps -ef | fzf
</code></pre></div><p>Or lines in a file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ cat foo.txt | fzf
</code></pre></div><p>Or the numbers 1-100:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ seq <span style="color:#ae81ff">100</span> | fzf
</code></pre></div><p>You get the idea. The other day I was thinking, what if we could pipe a list of every single task,
expanded over both chunks and platforms, into <code>fzf</code>? How useful would that be? Luckily, a list of
all taskcluster tasks can be generated with a mach command, so it was easy to test this out:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ mach taskgraph tasks -p artifacts/parameters.yml -q &gt; all-tasks.json
$ cat all-tasks.json | fzf -m
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>parameters.yml</code> file can be downloaded from any decision task on treeherder. I piped it into a
file because the <code>mach taskgraph</code> command takes a bit of time to complete, it&rsquo;s not a penalty we&rsquo;d
want to incur on subsequent runs unless it was necessary. The <code>-m</code> tells <code>fzf</code> to allow
multi-selection.</p>
<p>The results were wonderful. But rather than try to describe how awesome the new (potential) try
choosing experience was, I created a demo. In this scenario, pretend I want to select all linux32
opt mochitest-chrome tasks:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now instead of printing the task labels to <code>stdout</code>, imagine if this theoretical try chooser stuffed
that output into the commit&rsquo;s metadata. This is the last piece of the puzzle, to what I believe is a
comprehensive outline towards a viable replacement for try syntax.</p>
<h2 id="no-plan-survives-breakfast">No Plan Survives Breakfast</h2>
<p>As Mike Conley is fond of saying, no plan survives breakfast. I&rsquo;m sure my outline here is full of
holes that will need to be patched, but I think (hope) that at least the overall direction is solid.
While I&rsquo;d love to work on this, I won&rsquo;t have the time or mandate to do so until later in the year.
With this post I hope to accomplish three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Serve as a brain dump so when (or if) I do get back to it, I&rsquo;ll remember everything</li>
<li>Motivate others to push in this direction in the meantime (or better yet, implement the whole
thing!)</li>
<li>Provide an excuse to plug <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fuzzyfinder</a>. It&rsquo;s been months and using it still makes me giddy.
Seriously, give it a try, you&rsquo;ll be glad you did!</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me know if you have any feedback, and especially if you have any other crazy ideas for selecting
tasks on try!</p>
