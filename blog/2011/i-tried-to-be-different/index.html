  <p>Back in high school and throughout most of my University career, I&rsquo;ve always thought that personal blogs were dumb. Who in their right mind would care what <em>I</em> was up to?
It wasn&rsquo;t until I started interning at Mozilla that my views started to shift. I began seeing them as tools to communicate new ideas and elicit feedback from anyone
interested in what you have to say. It also wasn&rsquo;t until I started interning at Mozilla that I realized that I actually <em>might</em> have something interesting to say.
So here I am, creating a blog with one month left in my second internship. Too little too late? Maybe, but I have to start at some point.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This website is created with Django, and the blogging engine is using the <a href="https://github.com/codekoala/django-articles">django-articles</a> project.
While django-articles is an awesome little app that has saved me tons of time (and I&rsquo;d highly recommend it), there is one question that I keep asking myself.
Why didn&rsquo;t I just use wordpress? I could have been done in a matter of hours instead of days, I&rsquo;d have more features at my disposal and I could probably
find a better theme for my site as I am most definitely not a designer. One theory that I have is that I&rsquo;m a masochist. But I think it may be some combination of the
following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Personal learning</li>
<li>Django experience as my group and I are using it for a school project</li>
<li>Complete control over every aspect of the site</li>
<li>It <em>was</em> kind of fun</li>
<li>Wordpress is popular and I&rsquo;m a wannabe hipster</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, this website is still very much under construction and I know there are many parts that aren&rsquo;t finished yet
(for example it looks like crap if your browser doesn&rsquo;t support border-radius). I hope to clean it up a bit and add some meaningful content in the next month or so.</p>
